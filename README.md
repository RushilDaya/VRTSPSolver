# VRTSPSolver
MoAI TSP Genetic Algorithm Project

###Plan For Genetic Algorithms Project.
1. Get familiar with the genetic algorithm toolbox and the tsp code, run basic experiments, no need to record results at this stage. (2 hours).
2. Setup a pipeline for automating the recording of results and changing parameters, this will save a lot of time if we need to run ~ 50 tests for each configuration and make gradual adjustments to ~10 parameters (5 hours).
3. Research stopping criteria, implement the best one. (3 hours).
4. Review other representations and crossover methods, find the combination which seems to be the most promising (4 hours).
5. Implement the new representation and crossover method as generic functions (5 hours).
6. Implement local heuristics (2-opt, 3-opt, 4-opt, ...) (3 hours).
7. Sweep the parameter spaces of BOTH the original method and our method to find optimal parameters of BOTH algorithms on smaller problems (6 hours).
8. Test these 2 optimized models on benchmarked problems (6 hours).
9. Research and implement other parent selection schema (5 hours).
10. Research and implement Niching (6 hours).
11. Research and implement a survivor strategy other than elitism (5 hours).
12. Repeat step 7,8 for the new algorithms generated in (9,10,11) (6 hours).
13. Based on the results pick the best strategies from all previous stages and make a combined model, optimize and test this model (6 hours).
14. Additional problem which can be solved as a TSP type problem with GA (Extra).

__Write the report:__


* Literature review (2 pages) (6 hours).
* Discuss the implementation , all the different techniques we have tried (3 pages) (8 hours).
* Methodology (how did we test the models - pipeline/ parameter sweep / etc) (1 page) (2 hours).
* Results, the performance of all models. (3 pages) (6 hours).
* Analysis (3 pages) (10 hours).

Estimated Project time: 93 hours (~ 50h/pp).
